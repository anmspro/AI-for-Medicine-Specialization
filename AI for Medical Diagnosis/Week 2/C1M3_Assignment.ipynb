    "Of course our dataset is only a sample of the real world, and our calculated values for all above metrics is an estimate of the real world values. It would be good to quantify this uncertainty due to the sampling of our dataset. We'll do this through the use of confidence intervals. A 95\\% confidence interval for an estimate $\\hat{s}$ of a parameter $s$ is an interval $I = (a, b)$ such that 95\\% of the time when the experiment is run, the true value $s$ is contained in $I$. More concretely, if we were to run the experiment many times, then the fraction of those experiments for which $I$ contains the true parameter would tend towards 95\\%.\n",
    "\n",
    "While some estimates come with methods for computing the confidence interval analytically, more complicated statistics, such as the AUC for example, are difficult. For these we can use a method called the *bootstrap*. The bootstrap estimates the uncertainty by resampling the dataset with replacement. For each resampling $i$, we will get a new estimate, $\\hat{s}_i$. We can then estimate the distribution of $\\hat{s}$ by using the distribution of $\\hat{s}_i$ for our bootstrap samples.\n",
